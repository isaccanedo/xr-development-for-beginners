# C# Foundations

This unit serves as an introduction to programming using the C# (C Sharp) language. Although there are multiple languages that can be used in XR development, C# is one of the most commonly used due to its prevalence in the Unity Engine (which is the chosen engine for this curriculum).

## Objectives

- Create a basic Hello World application in C#.
- Understand and differentiate the languages data types, properly declaring variables as needed.
- Learn how to create a class in C# and create objects from it.
- Understand how to approach decisions in programming.
- Differentiate the types of loops and identify their usage scenarios.
