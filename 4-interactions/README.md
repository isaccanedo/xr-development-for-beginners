# Interactions

This unit introduces the basics of user-application interaction in XR. From hands and controller-enabled operation to gaze functions, XR offers a wide array of possibilities when it comes to interacting with digital objects and applications.

## Objectives

- Comprehend the different ways hands and motion controllers allow users to interact with a virtual environment.
- Differentiate the best use scenarios for hands, motion controller and hands free interaction models.
- Identify the different hands-free models alongside their strengths and challenges.
- Understand the gaze and commit model and how to properly design an application for its usage.
