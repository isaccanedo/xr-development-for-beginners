# Environmental Awareness

## Objectives

- Explain the value of spatial mapping for augmented reality experiences.
- Identify use cases for spatial awareness.
- Select the appropriate auditory cue(s) for an XR scene.

## Introduction

Creating the blend between the physical and digital world is a key characteristic of XR development. The technology leverages concepts such as spatial mapping, spatial awareness, and spatial audio to provide users with a realistic immersive experience. Together, these spatial concepts can truly enhance your XR experience and stay true to providing a seamless blend of the two worlds.

### Spatial Mapping

**Spatial mapping** creates a 3D map of the real-world environment and makes it possible to place 3D objects on real surfaces. More often, a mesh (viewable through the device's lens) is placed onto the real-world environment which is indicative of what the device identifies as a surface. As you move about your physical space, the mesh continuously updates and accounts for changes in your real-world environment.

Once your physical space is mapped, you're able to leverage the mapping for placing 3D objects onto real-world surfaces. Some devices are able to save mapped environments and either load on app start or import into your XR development platform for app creation.

### Spatial Awareness

**Spatial awareness** occurs when a 3D object is aware of it's real-world environment. The advantage of spatial awareness is that it provides a natural and familiar form of interaction to the user.

Physic is depicted an object moving. Navigation is depicted by a dog in a room.](../../images/spatial-mapping-scenarios.png)

Common usage scenarios for spatial awareness are:

**Placement**

In this scenario, a 3D vase is placed onto a real table. The 3D vase is aware of the table top's surface and snaps to the surface for placement.

**Occlusion**

In this scenario, a 3D chair is only visible when viewed on one side of the wall. **Occlusion** enables you to hide a virtual object. The 3D chair is aware of the wall separating the two rooms.

**Physics**

In this scenario, a 3D ball rolls off the surface of a table and onto the ground before being stopped by the wall. The 3D ball is aware of the objects it interacts with and behaves in an expected manner of rolling.

**Navigation**

In this scenario, a virtual robot navigates around a room, avoiding obstacles. The virtual robot can move around the environment while also being aware of obstacles that obstructs it's path of movement.

### Spatial Audio

We utilize our sense of hearing for communication, to listen and to respond, and also to locate objects around us. Auditory cues can provide a truly immersive experience - essentially mimicking how the user would expect to hear sound in the real world. **Spatial audio** provides this sense of realism by creating sound in 360 degrees around a listener.

There are four auditory cues:

- Ambient
- Object
- Movement
- Instruction

An **ambient auditory cue** is the background noise of an environment. This could be noise in a busy city or the sound of a tv playing off in the distance in another room. An **object auditory cue** is the sound produced from an object. For example, an air conditioning unit produces the sound of a hum when active. A **movement auditory cue** are sounds that are the result of movement. If someone were to run across pavement, we would expect to hear their feet hit the ground. As for an **informational auditory cues**, it's the audio that provides instructions. For example, step-by-step instruction on how to operate machinery.

Placement of the audio plays a major role in how audio is perceived by the user. We can leverage spatial audio features and settings within XR development platforms to fine-tune sound placement and volume.
