# Core Concepts

This unit covers foundational concepts necessary to understand developing for an immersive 3-dimensional environment. Some of these concepts include how to make digital objects behave like real ones and how to ensure that users are comfortable while interacting with an XR application.

## Objectives

- Understand the concept of comfort and identify the different factors that play a role in enhancing a XR experience to feel real.
- Understand the concept of coordinate systems and how these are used to mimic real world positioning.
- Understand how forces and pivots work and their importance in XR development.
