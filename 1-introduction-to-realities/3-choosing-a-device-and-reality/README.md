# Choosing a Device and Reality

## Objectives

- Evaluate the proper reality and XR device(s) for an app or experience.
- Recognize the impact that audience has on choosing a device.
- Identify the environmental impact on rendering 3D experiences.

## Introduction

Not all XR experiences are created equally. While you can port an experience from one device to another, some experiences are better for AR while others are best for VR. There's various factors to consider such as the environment, device capabilities, interaction requirements, the audience, etc.

As you decide on a reality and device thatâ€™s appropriate for your app or experience, consider how your choice impacts the overall use and experience. As XR technology continues to progress, new solutions such as adaptive controllers or OpenXR are introduced to resolve common problems developers face when creating apps.

### Are you developing for augmented reality or virtual reality?

If the experience requires the user to be fully immersive with no view of their real-world environment, then VR is the better solution. However, if users are expected to interact with both virtual objects and the real-world surrounding them, then AR is the best reality.

### Who is the intended audience for your app?

As you think about audience, consider demographics such as age, location, and disabilities. Although there is no standard age requirement for AR and VR devices, the use of VR devices is a topic of debate for children. Various studies have been conducted on the effects of VR and children as it relates to developing fill motor skills, visual and physical comfort, and the ability to verbally express or conceive whether they're in harm while immersed in a virtual world. On the contrary, there are VR apps and experiences available for children. However, consider doing your research before deciding on the use of VR for a children's app.

As for location, for some devices, availability is restricted. Therefore, if your creating an app for a specific AR supported or VR device, ensure that the device is accessible wherever your audience is located. Likewise, consider affordability of the device for communities which may not have the financial means to invest in particular XR devices. This can minimize access and create a rift in who can and cannot use your app.

Accounting for users with different abilities also has an impact on whether adaptive controllers are required for interactions and whether the physical structure of a device is comfortable for a user.

### Are high quality graphics required for your app to be experienced as intended?

Rendering high quality graphics can impact whether the device of choice requires a high-powered CPU. When this occurs, the device is usually tethered to another device such as a computer or gaming console which can provide the power that is needed. One thing to keep in mind is that if the app requires a device to be tethered, the user is limited in movable space.

### Can someone use your app in any environment? Or are there limitations?

Different environmental factors can impact whether a device is able to render virtual objects as intended. As an example, you'd likely utilize devices such as the HoloLens 2 and Magic Leap One indoors as opposed to a mobile phone which can be used both indoors and outdoors. For the HoloLens 2 and Magic Leap One, the intensity of the sun can negatively impact how virtual objects are rendered - whereas the objects may appear to be faint.

As for VR devices, you'll want to avoid dark environments as light is required to keep track of your environment. Therefore, you'd need to opt for a well-lit environment. There's also the potential to use VR devices outside as well.

### Can someone use your app across different types of devices?

Not all devices share the same features and thus can limit the ability to engage with a XR app in the same manner across devices. For example, some HMDs support hand tracking (which gives the ability to interact with your hands) while others are only support interactions with the use of controllers. There's way to account for these differences in your app design by enabling the user to choose either mode of interaction. Another limitation is platform support. You may find some XR apps only supported on iOS rather than both iOS and Android. Fortunately, APIs such as OpenXR enables you to create for one platform and deploy to many.
