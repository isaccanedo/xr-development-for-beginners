# Devices

## Objectives

- Identify XR devices by type.
- Describe the characteristics of each type of XR device.
- Summarize the differences between tethered vs. untethered devices.

## Introduction

Choosing the appropriate device for your app is a decision which should be made early on before entering the design phase. The impact that this decision has could be a matter of whether you’ll need to account for the use of additional hardware such as controllers, or whether the user must be in an environment that’s suitable to try the app.

### Head Mounted

A **head mounted device** (HMD) is a device that’s worn on the head. Used for both AR and VR, head mounted devices enable you to view virtual objects through a small display that’s placed in front of your eyes. Unlike VR headsets, AR headsets allow you to view both the real-world and virtual objects simultaneously. As for VR headsets, you’re fully immersed in a virtual environment, only able to view what’s in the virtual world surrounding you. HMDs not only display images but may be equipped with speakers, a microphone, and/or a camera. There are various ways to interact with augmented and virtual objects while wearing a HMD such as the use of motion controllers, eye tracking, hands, and voice.

### Smart Glasses

**Smart glasses** are glasses that can overlay augmented images in front of your real-world view. Alongside the arm of the ear rest is the **central processing unit** (CPU), or the brain of the glasses. You can perform most tasks with smart glasses that you’d perform on a computer or mobile phone. Smart glasses may be equipped with speakers, a microphone, and/or a camera. Interactions are performed through either touch (such as the glasses arm) or hand gestures displayed in front of the glasses’ camera.

### Mobile

With smartphones and tablets, AR apps can overlay augmented images in front of your real-world view. You can interact with AR objects by either touching the screen, using your voice, or doing a gesture in front of the devices’ camera. Viewing AR apps on mobile devices requires an AR software system such as ARCore (Android) or ARKit (iOS).

Smartphones can also be used for viewing VR apps - but this does require a compatible VR app. Your smartphone is placed inside a viewer which contains lenses and in some cases a button for interacting with the app. To create a 3D effect, two images are displayed, one for each eye. The slight offset of the images tricks the brain into forming a single image with an added dimension of depth.

### Haptics

The buzz you feel when your phone vibrates or the shaking of a video game controller when you hit an obstacle are both examples of haptic technology. **Haptic technology** refers to any technology that can create an experience of touch by applying forces, vibrations, or motions to the user. In VR, a haptic device can provide a sense of realism for the person that’s engaged in an immersive experience. Haptic devices can enable you to interact with the virtual world in a more natural manner.

Graspable haptic devices can simulate the feeling one feels when grabbing a real-world object. Such controllers can give you the feeling of vibrating sensations felt through your hands or crushing a virtual object and feeling the shape of the object crumble.

Wearable haptic devices make it possible to feel touch sensations against your body. A full haptic bodysuit enables you to feel virtual hugs as though you received the hug in real-life. Haptic gloves enable you to touch objects in the virtual world and feel the sensation of its surface.

### Tethered or Untethered

Some headsets require a connection to a device with high processing power such as a computer or game console. Devices that require such connection are referred to as tethered.

**Tethered headsets** leverage the computer’s or console processing power. Therefore, if you’re using a tethered headset, it’s recommended to connect the headset to a device with strong computing power. The cable connection helps reduce the lag time, or latency, between what you physically see and do vs. movement in the virtual world. If there’s significant delay between the two movements, you’ll not only feel less immersed but may also experience nausea. While headsets tethered to devices with insufficient computing power can still deliver VR experiences, you’ll risk latency issues and the images may be more pixelated.

Wireless headsets are referred to as untethered. **Untethered headsets** are a fully self-contained unit that’s equipped with all the necessary hardware and the power source built into a singular device. Rather than rely on an external source for processing power, an untethered headset relies on it’s own internal hardware. Untethered devices can still deliver a decent VR experience, however they lack the response time necessary to avoid latency issues. But unlike tethered headsets, you have more freedom to move around in your space.
