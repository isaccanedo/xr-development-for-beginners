# Capstone Project

## Overview

Throughout this curriculum, you've learned a range of concepts related to XR development. While this curriculum is the just the beginning of becoming familiar with XR development, the concepts you've learned will carry over onto more complex app development. This capstone project serves as an opportunity to demonstrate what you've learned over the course of the past 7 units. For your capstone project, develop an XR application to be deployed to your XR device of choice. You could either transform the basketball game app created in this curriculum or create a new project.

You are encouraged to explore concepts not covered in this curriculum to aid in creating your project.

## Expectations

- Plan an approach that follows the workflow introduced in the curriculum: Design, Prototype, Develop, Deploy.
- Create or import assets such as models or materials. Royalty-free 3D models and textures are available at [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/), [CGTrader](https://www.cgtrader.com/), and [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/).
- Create the application in Unity.
- Create a 2-page written rationale that includes the following:
  - The app's intended audience.
  - An explanation for your device decision.
  - An explanation of your development workflow.
  - A story board of the app.
  - Design & environmental considerations that influenced your development decisions.
  - Scripts documented to explain app logic.

## Rubric

| Criteria | Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------- |
|Create a functional app prototype for AR or VR.          |App functions well with no errors.           |App produces some errors but works.          |App is not functional.                   |
|Identify app audience.          |Chosen audience is appropriate for the app.           |Chosen audience is appropriate for some parts of the app.          |Chosen audience is not appropriate for the app.                   |
|Explanation for device decision.          |Chosen device is appropriate for the app.           |Chosen device is appropriate for some interactions but not all.          |Chosen device is not appropriate for the app.                   |
|Explanation for development workflow.          |Workflow is clear and organized.           |Some parts of the workflow are organized but overall clarity is lacking.          |Development workflow is not organized.                   |
|Create a storyboard for the app.          |Storyboard identifies a clear end-to-end experience which considers different decision making paths.           |Storyboard identifies an end-to-end experience with one decision making path.          |Storyboard does not identify a clear end-to-end experience.                   |
|Identify design and environmental impact on decision making.          |Rationale for design and environmental impact takes into account various factors.           |Minimal consideration for design and environmental impact (3 or less factors considered).          |No consideration for design and environmental impact.                   |
|Create documented scripts for app logic.          |Script is well documented with comments to explain end-to-end what the code does.           |Script contains some comments to explain logic but does not provide full picture.          |Scripts lack comments to explain what the code does.                   |
